# Bubble Sort

**Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are not in the intended order. The largest element is placed at the end of the index during each iteration.**

## Algorithm
1. Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
2. If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
3. Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
4. The above process goes on until the last element.

**Time Complexity :**

Best : O(n)

Worst : O(n^2)

Average : O(n^2)

**Space Complexity :** O(1) for all cases.

**In-place**: Yes

**Stability** : Yes
